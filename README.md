# hkaudio
*hkaudio* is my attempt at doing a simple yocto distribution for the rpi that implements an audio player with support
for librespot and squeezelite. In addition to these tools, the distro provides the resource management needed to be able
to switch between the two player applications as needed.

All code in this repository is in the public domain - use it for whatever purpose ...
